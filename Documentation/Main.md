# Welcome to the official [Storm](https://github.com/Modleyyy/Storm) Documentation!
***Tired of those big game frameworks and engines that tend to take years to set up? Storm got your back! üå©Ô∏è***

## Features
- *Easy to use and really small*! ***~~(Performance is not garenteed)~~***
- Really simple *GameObject ‚Üí Component* architecture!
- *Spritesheet animation*! Not the easiest thing to get started with, but still useful!
- A *Tweening* system with *tons of built-in easings*!
- *Pixel shaders* to add some variety! There's already some *built-in shaders*!
- You can also play *Audio* really easily! Although it only supports Wav audio... (WHY MICROSOFT?!?!?!)
- A simple *Physics engine* with AABB and Circle body collision detection and Linear Velocity movement, plus the bodies can even be static! There's even "IsOnFloor/Ceiling/Wall" methods! (They work but they're really performance heavy so be aware if you call them every frame!)

Some more stuff are to come like text rendering, particles and more, so be aware for that!
